                            of their club.
                            Different plant for every club planted in a queue looks beautiful and nature friendly.

                        Niramayam is a student group of Yoga enthusiasts formed in February 2018 with the objective of
                        spreading awareness among the students regarding the importance of physical as well as mental
                        health, providing complete knowledge on how to be fit and healthy in today's hectic life.
                        Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness, increases body awareness, relieves
                        chronic stress patterns; relaxes the mind, centers attention, and sharpens concentration which
                        is the most essential part of a student's life. Our aim is to make people self-aware and
                        self-motivated towards their body and health. For this, we organise practice sessions open to
                        all and practise regularly in the college premises.

                        At Ananya, we regularly organise sessions of debate, group discussions, creative writing,
                        turncoat etc which are open for everyone to participate. We also organise a major event like

                        it is a medium through which we pen down our ideas and opinions creatively and present it on the
                        walls of Kalam Chowk. Moreover, Ananya also does the anchoring and stage handling during
                        freshers' and annual cultural festival of our university, Elements Culmyca. At Ananya, we
                        believe that words are powerful and they can abolish almost everything that spreads negativity
                        and terrorise one's freedom of expression.

                        In today's world everyone is living under the arms of demons of stress, depression, monotony and
                        anxiety. Our brains are clamped in the chains of only work and our heart has forgotten to fly.
                        People have become so engrossed in their studies and work-life that they have forgotten to
                        embrace small beauties of the world like the warmth of sunshine, the melodious chirping of
                        birds, changing colors of leaves in different seasons and the coldness of moon. Everyone is so
                        eager to win the ratrace that they choke off their hobbies and interests and hidden talents
                        remain hidden.
                        The only solution to make people feel alive once again is to trigger their imagination by art
                        and one of the most effective ways is storytelling.

                        India is a unique nation, whose fabric has been woven by diverse linguistic, cultural and
                        religious threads, held together into a composite national identity by a rich history of
                        cultural evolution, coupled with a rousing freedom struggle that was built around the tenets of
                        non-violence and justice. The spirit of mutual understanding amidst a shared history has enabled
                        a special unity in diversity, which stands out as a tall flame of nationhood that needs to be
                        nourished and cherished into the future.

                        Time and technology have narrowed down distances in terms of connect and communication. In an
                        era that facilitates mobility and outreach, it is important to establish cultural exchanges
                        between people of different regions, as a means to further human bonding and a common approach
                        to nation-building. Mutual understanding and trust are the foundations of India's strength and
                        all citizens should feel culturally integrated in all corners of India. Students from the
                        north-east, for example, should not feel like 'strangers in a strange land' when they arrive in
                        Delhi.

                        In India, the idea of involving students in the task of national service dates back to the times
                        of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation. The central theme which he tried to impress upon
                        his student audience time and again, was that they should always keep before them, their social
                        responsibility. The first duty of the students should be, not to treat their period of study as
                        one of the opportunities for indulgence in intellectual luxury, but for preparing themselves for
                        final dedication in the service of those who provided the sinews of the nation with the national
                        goods & services so essential to society. Advising them to form a living contact with the
                        community in whose midst their institution is located, he suggested that instead of undertaking
                        academic research about economic and social disability, the students should do "something
                        positive so that the life of the villagers might be raised to a higher material and moral
                        level".

                        he Motto of NSS "Not Me But You", reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need
                        for self-less service. NSS helps the students development & appreciation to other person's point
                        of view and also show consideration towards other living beings. The philosophy of the NSS is a
                        good doctrine in this motto, which underlines on the belief that the welfare of an individual is
                        ultimately dependent on the welfare of the society as a whole and therefore, the NSS volunteers
                        shall strive for the well-being of the society.

                        field of electronics. We have been taking open
                        sessions on various topics related to our
                        learning so as to let people grow technically.
                        Our enormous participation in various zonal,
                        national and international levels events has
                        made us climb the ladder each year with visible
                        difference. We hence give the students a
                        chance to evolve technically for future
                        prospects also providing them hands on
                        experience at the same time.
