                        Niramayam is a student group of Yoga enthusiasts formed in February 2018 with the objective of
                        spreading awareness among the students regarding the importance of physical as well as mental
                        health, providing complete knowledge on how to be fit and healthy in today's hectic life.
                        Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness, increases body awareness, relieves
                        chronic stress patterns; relaxes the mind, centers attention, and sharpens concentration which
                        is the most essential part of a student's life. Our aim is to make people self-aware and
                        self-motivated towards their body and health. For this, we organise practice sessions open to
                        all and practise regularly in the college premises.

                        anxiety. Our brains are clamped in the chains of only work and our heart has forgotten to fly.
                        People have become so engrossed in their studies and work-life that they have forgotten to
                        embrace small beauties of the world like the warmth of sunshine, the melodious chirping of
                        birds, changing colors of leaves in different seasons and the coldness of moon. Everyone is so
                        eager to win the ratrace that they choke off their hobbies and interests and hidden talents
                        remain hidden.
                        The only solution to make people feel alive once again is to trigger their imagination by art
                        and one of the most effective ways is storytelling.
